## Overview ðŸ§­

## Learning Objectives ðŸ§ 

By the end of this section, you should be able to:

* Define open source and describe the main pillars of open source software.

## The Origins Of Open Source ðŸŒ±

Sharing software began almost as the computer age emerged the practice of sharing software was often the norm in the early days of Computer Science.

The image below shows a condensed timeline of the Origins of open source.

![Timeline of the Origins of open source](./images/OSS-early-timeline.svg)

* In the early years of computing (1950-1960s) software was often a research activity and was often released under the public domain, meaning that these works could not be owned by an individual or a collective.
* Later, in the 1960s, with the rise of compilers and Operating Systems (OS) also came the rise of software-only companies.
* In 1974 software was granted the ability to be copyrighted, which marks the start of software as a commodity.
* In the Early 1980s, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) was founded by Richard Stallman, which was the first organization to advocate for free software. Within that decade Stallman also wrote the [Free Software Definition][free-software-definition].
* Around this same time, the GNU Public License (GPL), was created and the first Linux kernel was released under such license.
* In the 1998s, the term open source was coined by a group of industry and free software individuals and the Open Source Initiative (OSI) was founded.

## Pragmatism vs. Social Movement

> Open Source is a development methodology; free software is a social movement
> `-`*Richard Stallman*

### The Four Freedoms

The Free Software Foundation is the organization responsible for defending the **Four Freedoms**. These freedoms establish the requisites for a piece of software to be considered free software.

* **Freedom 0**: The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
* **Freedom 1**: The freedom to study how the program works, and change it, so it does your computing as you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
* **Freedom 2**: The freedom to redistribute copies, so you can help others.
* **Freedom 3**: The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

However, the word *free* in Free Software has often been conflated with *free, as in no price tag included*.

> **Note:**
> *Free software* does not mean *noncommercial*. On the contrary, a free program must be available for commercial use, commercial development, and commercial distribution.
